# QuantumLearning
Collection of codes of different quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning approaches. I primarily work with Python, implementing Qiskit, PennyLane, and custom modules.

#### Core quantum computing algorithms
- [ ] Quantum random number generator (QRNG)
- [ ] Quantum walk
- [ ] Quantum Fourier transform (QFT)
- [ ] Grover's algorithm

#### Quantum machine learning
- [ ] Quantum support vector machines (QSVMs)
- [x] Hybrid quantum neural network  (hQNN)
